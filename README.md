# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)


The project aimed to create a comprehensive eCommerce database, load raw data into it, clean and transform the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, perform quality assurance checks, and ultimately derive meaningful insights from the data. The key objectives were to enhance data integrity, resolve data quality issues, establish reliable relationships between tables, and enable effective data analysis. This involved addressing issues such as missing values, inconsistent data types, duplicates, and outliers. The project's overarching goal was to provide a trustworthy and structured dataset for insightful analysis, decision-making, and reporting within the eCommerce domain.

-------------------

## Process

The SQL project involved several steps from creating the eCommerce database to data loading, cleaning, quality assurance, and analysis.

### (your step 1)


Created the ecommerce database and loaded the tables such as "all_sessions," "analytics," "products," "sales_by_sku," and "sales_report.


### (your step 2)


Comprehensive cleaning of the data (which includes data profiling, transformation, validation, and enhancement steps) and quality assurance tests.

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

1.	Identify Effective Purchase Channels: This data reveals which channels are most successful in driving website purchases. By counting channel occurrences for visitors with positive transaction revenue, you gain insights into the favored channels of purchasing customers.

2.	Assess Channel Grouping Impact on Revenue: By calculating total revenue per channel grouping, this information allows you to gauge each channel's contribution to overall earnings. It aids in pinpointing the most influential channels in terms of revenue generation.

3.	Highlight High-Revenue Products: This data unveils products with the highest revenue generation. By associating product names with their revenue figures and aggregating these values, you identify top-selling products that significantly bolster total revenue.

4.	Identify Best-Selling Products by Quantity: This data assists in identifying products with the highest sales volume. By summing the quantities of each product sold, it reveals the products with the greatest number of units sold.

5.	Evaluate Transaction Performance and Restocking Time: By combining transaction revenue with restocking lead time, this information helps evaluate product performance. It identifies products that not only yield substantial revenue but also maintain efficient restocking cycles, indicating optimized inventory management.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

1.  Time Constraints: Completing the project within a given timeframe was a constraint. Balancing thorough data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation while meeting deadlines required efficient time management.

2.  Data Quality and Completeness: Ensuring data quality was a significant challenge. The data came from diverse sources, leading to inconsistencies, missing values, and inaccuracies. Cleaning and transforming the data to a usable format were crucial but time-consuming tasks.

3.  Data Transformation and Manipulation: Converting data types, renaming columns, and applying transformations required meticulous attention to detail. Ensuring that the right conversions were applied to maintain data integrity was challenging.

4.  Data Integration: Merging data from multiple sources, such as different tables, posed challenges. Matching and aligning data points required careful attention to ensure accurate analysis.

5.  Duplicates and Outlier Handling: Addressing duplicates and outliers was necessary to ensure the accuracy of analysis results. Identifying whether duplicates and outliers were genuine data points or errors required domain knowledge and decision-making.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

1.  Deeper Data Exploration: Spend more time exploring the data to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies. This could involve using advanced visualization techniques and statistical analysis to gain deeper insights.

2.  Advanced Modeling: Apply advanced analytical techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, to predict customer behavior, revenue trends, or other relevant insights. This could provide more accurate forecasts and actionable recommendations.
